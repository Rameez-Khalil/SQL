Template0: 
	This is used to create template1.
	This is a backup of template1.
	Never ever change this.

Template1: 
	This is the template that is used to create new databases.
	This is our default.
	Any changes that we make to the template are automatically applied to all the 
	DBs that are extending it.


IF TEMPLATE1 IS BEING ACCESSED, NO NEW DBS CAN BE CREATED UNTIL THE CONNECTION IS CLOSED.


THIS IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE OUR DATABASE WITH OUR OWN TEMPLATE.
	create database <name>
	create table <tablename>
	create database <name> WITH TEMPLATE <templatename>.
