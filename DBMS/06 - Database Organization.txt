Database Organization:	
	There are several tables, views etc. We want to give a method to our madness.
	Schemas help us to organize.

POSTGRES SCHEMAS: 
	PG offers the concepts of schemas, a box in which one can organize tables, views, indexes.
	By default each database gets a public.
	Unless we specify the schema, the default is public.

	SELECT * FROM employees === SELECT * FROM public.Employees;
