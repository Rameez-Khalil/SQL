SDLC: 
	Software development life cycle.
	1. Planning and selection - What we want.
	2. System Analysis - What our system needs based off of what we want. 
	3. System Design - Architecture diagrams. 
	4. System Implementation and Orientation.


	The goal of this process is to design robust systems.
	This approach can be implemented in a variety of ways: 
	 	Agile, Waterfall, V-Model.



SDLC PHASES: 
	PHASE 1: Get the information of what needs to be done?
	PHASE 2: Based off of the information gathered, analyze if it can be done on time and budget.
	PHASE 3: System Architecture for all related components databases, apps.
	PHASE 4: Build the software.
	PHASE N: TESTING MAINTENANCE.

SYSTEM DESIGN:

This can be achieved via 2 approaches. 

	TOP-DOWN: 
		1. We start from 0.
	BOTTOM UP:
		1. When we have something available at hand, we start from there - Doctor analyzing the patient.
	
	We will be using both of these.
