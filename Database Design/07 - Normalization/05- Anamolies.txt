INSERTION ANAMOLIES: 
	

This occurs when certain attributes cannot be inserted into the database without the presence of other attributes. For example, if you have a customer record with a primary key but no associated order records, you might not be able to insert new orders for that customer.
Inconsistent Information:

Inconsistency arises when updating one part of the data leads to inconsistencies or conflicts with other parts. For instance, updating the price of a product in one place and not updating it elsewhere can result in inconsistencies.
Redundant Information:

Redundancy refers to the unnecessary repetition of data. This can lead to data inconsistency and is often associated with non-normalized databases..
