SECOND NORMAL FORM: 
	The records must satisfy the first normal form.
	All non key attributes must be fully dependent on candidate key.
	Every table should have a primary key, and relationship between tables must be formed using foreign key.


Rule#2
	1. Suppose you've a table Employee, the employee table contains name, employee id, and the salary and date of salary as well.
	To satisfy the rule#2 of Normalization, we should create another table for storing the details of salaries
	against each employee, we then must create a relationship table / intermediate table, to keep track
	of which salary belongs to who.
	2. So your salaries table will've its own table with its own primary key, and employee id can be used as a primary
	key for employee table, and the relationship table can carry the relation between two tables.
