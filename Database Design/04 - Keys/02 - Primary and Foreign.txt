PRIMARY KEY: 
	1. Inside of a table we could've many combinations for candidate and super.
	2. Once we have a column, that can uniquely identify our record, that becomes
	a primary key.
	3. Its by convention that we should be having single column selected as 
	primary key.


FOREGIN KEY: 
	Reference a key from a different table.
	Suppose, that you have an employee table, with column, id, and manager id.
	You've another table that contains lower grade employees with a managerid column.
	In this case, the managerid becomes the foreign key as it indicates who this
	lower grade employee report to.
