MANY TO MANY: 
	Technically possible, but you wouldn't want to do it.
	It creates overhead for insert/update etc.
	

EXAMPLE: 
	1. Suppose, you've a book table with book id, name, author etc.
	2. You've another table of author, and these two tables have a many to many 
	relationship, meaning multiple books can belong to multiple authors.
	3. So for every book, we will add under the book table we will have to create a column
	for that in the authors table to keep track.

	
This can be done effectively by adding a new table (intermediate table) which can store
book_id and author_id.

1 book can belong to multiple authors.
1 and 1 author could've written multiple books.
