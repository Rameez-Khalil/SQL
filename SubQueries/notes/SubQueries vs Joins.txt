Both joins and subqueries concatenate data.
SubQueries can stand alone.
Joins work on the basis of matching conditions, however, subqueries don't really need it.

SUBQUERIES OUTPUT: 
	Subqueries can result a rowset or singular value.
	Joins can only return a row set.

SUBQUERIES RESULTS:
	Subqueries results are immediately used.
	Joined table can be used in the outer query.
